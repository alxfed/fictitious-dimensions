# fictitious-dimensions
Since the times of d'Alembert, Lagrange and Euler humans like to add fictitious dimensions to their real-world physical and mathematical problems. This art was perfected in the XX-th century by Heisenberg, Pauli and Dirac in their 'matrix mechanic'. In the XXI-st century we can contribute to this proud tradition too, we have computers! :)
